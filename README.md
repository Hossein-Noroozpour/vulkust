# Vulkust (unstable, work in progress)

An experimental tiny engine for **Vulkan in Rust**.

<br>
<br>

## Missions

 1. Safety
 2. Performance
 3. Fast development
 4. Small executable binary file
 5. Cross-platform
 6. Maintainable code

## Examples

- First of all master branch may become unstable or even uncompilable. 
  (I'm gonna create a release branch in the first stable version)
- You must have **glslangValidator** in you PATH environment variable.
- For **iOS** and **Android**, you must have
  [vulkust-ios](https://github.com/Hossein-Noroozpour/vulkust-ios) and
  [vulkust-android](https://github.com/Hossein-Noroozpour/vulkust-android)
  projects next to the vulkust root.
