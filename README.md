## 3-Examples

- First of all master branch may become unstable or even uncompilable. 
  (I'm gonna create a release branch in the first stable version)
- You must have **glslangValidator** in you PATH environment variable.
- For **iOS** and **Android**, you must have
  [vulkust-ios](https://github.com/Hossein-Noroozpour/vulkust-ios) and
  [vulkust-android](https://github.com/Hossein-Noroozpour/vulkust-android)
  projects next to the vulkust root.

## 4-License

- You can do whatever you want to do with it, but every consequences are on you.
- You can not say that you have written this.
